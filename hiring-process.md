# Hiring Process

## Approach

We would like to be as transparent as possible about our hiring process so that you know what to expect. We are open to feedback as we would love to continually improve our process.

Below is a list of steps in our interview process. People are unique and so the process below may not always happen in the order stated below.

## Step 0

Initial conversation. Once you apply, someone will have an initial chat with you to check that you and Carbon are likely to be a good fit for each other.

## Step 1

We’ll ask you to complete a short coding assignment, to give you the opportunity to show us how you code. We will use the assignment to assess your ability to:

- Reason through a programming problem
- Write code that meets the requirements
- Write code that is easy to understand and extend
- Write tests that document and safeguard the program's behaviour
- Use a version control system (e.g. git) effectively to convey intent and keep changes small

It’s designed to be a short assignment, because we know you have better things to do than code for free.

## Step 2

Pair programming interview (1 - 1.5 hours)

### What we'll do

- You'll be asked to join a Google Meet call and share your screen
- We'll use your solution to the coding assignment as a base. Please have your solution up and running at the start of the call.
- We'll spend a little time talking about the code together
- We'll then work together to extend your solution in a couple of ways
- We'll also speak about how you might approach some bigger extensions

### What we're hoping to learn from you

- See first-hand how you approach problems
- See how you code
- Hear how you talk about code and technical problems
- Get a glimpse of what it’s like to work with you
- See your strengths in action

### What you can learn from us

- Get a glimpse of what it’s like to work with us
- See how we like to approach problems

## Step 3

Technical interview (45 mins - 1 hour)

### What we'll do

- We'll ask you to tell us about your experience and what excites you
- We'll ask you to tell us about some interesting products or projects you've worked on recently
- We'll ask you to tell us more about the interesting technical challenges that came up


### What we're hoping to learn from you

- How you approach and reason about technical challenges
- How well you understand your previous work and how well you can explain it
- Get a glimpse of what it's like to work with you
- Hear what your technical and architectural opinions are
- Learn more about the strengths we think you'll bring
- Hear how you'll approach the aspects you'll need to learn while working with us
- Notice if there are any mismatches between our expectations and yours

### What you can learn from us

- Ask questions about our technical stack
- Ask about the technically interesting parts of our work
- Hear how we think about technology and building products

## Further steps

After the technical portion of the interview process, you'll get a chance to meet more of the team, including our Lead Designer and Director. They'll want to get to know you, talk to you about your expectations, find out how you like to approach your work, and see if they'd enjoy working with you.
